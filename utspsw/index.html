    <div class="col-6"><p><strong>FLU</strong> better known as the flu, is an infectious disease caused by the RNA virus from the family Orthomyxoviridae (influenza virus), which attacks poultry and mammals. The most common symptoms of this disease are chills, fever, sore throat, muscle aches, severe headaches, coughing, weakness, and general discomfort.
    Although often confused with other influenza-like illnesses, especially colds, influenza is a more severe illness than colds and is caused by a different type of virus. [2] Influenza can cause nausea, and vomiting, especially in children, [1] but the symptoms it is more common in gastroenteritis, which is completely unrelated, which is also sometimes incorrectly referred to as "stomach flu." [3] Flu can sometimes cause viral pneumonia directly or cause secondary bacterial pneumonia. But dont worry about this, Because we can handle this disease.</p></div>

    <div class="col-6"><p><strong>DIARE</strong> is a disease when feces or stools turn soft or runny which usually occurs at least three times in 24 hours. In developing countries, diarrhea is the most common cause of death for under-fives, and also kills more than 2.6 million people each year.This condition can be a symptom of injuries, illness, allergies (fructose, lactose), excess vitamin C, and eating certain fruits. Usually accompanied by abdominal pain and sometimes nausea and vomiting. There are several other conditions that involve but not all symptoms of diarrhea, and the official medical definition of diarrhea is defecation that exceeds 200 grams per day.Eating foods that are acidic, spicy, or bersantan at once can cause excessive diarrhea as well as making the intestine shock.This occurs when insufficient fluid is absorbed by the large intestine. As part of the digestion process, or because of fluid intake, food is mixed with large amounts of water. Therefore digested food consists of liquid before it reaches the large intestine. The large intestine absorbs water, leaving the other material as a semi-solid impurities. If the large intestine is damaged / inflammation, absorption does not occur and the result is runny stool.

    <div class="col-6"><p><strong>CHICKEN POX</strong> is an infectious disease caused by a varicella-zoster virus infection. This disease is spread aerogenically.In the beginning, the sufferer will feel a little fever, runny nose, quickly feel tired, lethargic, and weak. These symptoms are typical for viral infections. This skin rash may feel a bit painful or itchy so it can scratch accidentally. If the resilience is left it will immediately dry to form a scab (crust) which will later be released and leave patches on the skin that is darker (hyperpigmentation). These patches will fade over time so that some time later will not leave marks again.Another case if the chickenpox resilience is solved. Crust will soon form deeper so that it will dry longer. this condition makes it easy for bacterial infections to occur in the scratching scar. after drying the chicken pox former will remove the deep scars. Moreover, if the sufferer is an adult or young adult, chickenpox scars will be more difficult to disappear.But dont worry, we have the medicine.</p></div>
